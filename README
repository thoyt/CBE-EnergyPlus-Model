						####### QuickStart Guide ######

This short guide will help you get up and running with the excel interface and CBE Model.

1. The model is compatible only with the CBE development version of EnergyPlus. The best
   way to work in this environment is to download the latest version of EnergyPlus from 
   http://energyplus.gov, and install it in your C: directory.
   
2. Replace EnergyPlus.exe with the CBE development version of the EnergyPlus executable.

3. Replace EnergyPlus.idd with the CBE version of the idd. This file defines the input
   structure of EnergyPlus, which we have augmented to implement special features.
   
4. Create a folder in C:\EnergyPlusVxxxxx called CBE. This folder can serve as a place
   to store different models.
   
5. Copy CBE-EnergyPlus-Model to this directory. This is found at
   https://github.com/thoyt/CBE-EnergyPlus-Model. This README is itself contained in
   this folder as well.
   
6. Populate C:\EnergyPlusVxxxxx\WeatherData with the required weather files, bundled
   here in CBE-WeatherData.zip
   
7. Launch the excel interface found in the Interfaces\ folder. Hit go, and see if it works!
